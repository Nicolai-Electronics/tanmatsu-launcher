            When enabled, sd_fopen() and sd_fclose() will allocate stdio buffers
            in internal DMA-capable RAM instead of PSRAM. This significantly
            improves SD card read/write performance on ESP32-P4 by avoiding
            PSRAM cache synchronization overhead.

            Enabling this uses approximately 8KB of internal RAM per open file
            (up to 8 files tracked).
